# Bubble Shooter Game

This is the main class for the Bubble Shooter game. It sets up the main window (JFrame) for the game, including its size, layout, background color, and position on the screen. The game involves shooting bubbles to match three or more of the same color to clear them from the board and score points.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Shoot bubbles to match three or more of the same color and clear the board. The game provides a fun and engaging experience with increasing difficulty as you progress.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your score as you clear bubbles. The score increases based on the number of bubbles cleared in a single shot and the total number of bubbles cleared.

## Usage

To start the game, run the main method in the main class file. This will launch the game window where you can begin playing.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LTPPPP/Bubble-Shooter
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans).
3. Navigate to the main class file, typically named `BubbleShooter.java` or similar.
4. Run the main method to launch the game window.
5. Use your mouse to aim and shoot bubbles. Match three or more bubbles of the same color to clear them from the board. The game uses a simple point-and-click mechanism for aiming and shooting.
6. The game ends when the bubbles reach the bottom of the screen. Try to clear as many bubbles as possible to achieve a high score. The game keeps track of your highest score, allowing you to challenge yourself to beat it.

## Tech Stack

The Bubble Shooter game is built entirely using Java and Java Swing. Java is a versatile and widely-used programming language that provides a robust platform for building various types of applications. Java Swing is a part of Java's standard library and is used for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

- **Java**: The core programming language used for the game logic, including bubble movement, collision detection, and score tracking. Java's object-oriented features and extensive libraries make it an ideal choice for game development.
- **Java Swing**: Used for creating the game's GUI, including the main window (JFrame), buttons, and other interactive components. Swing provides a rich set of components and a flexible architecture for building sophisticated user interfaces. It allows for custom rendering and handling of user input, which is essential for a game like Bubble Shooter.
